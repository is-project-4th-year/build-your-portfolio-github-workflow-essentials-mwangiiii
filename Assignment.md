## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

1. I honestly thought Git was just like Google Drive but for code just push and pull, and that’s it.
    -    It’s way more powerful. Git tracks every little change, helps you go back in time, and lets you work on new features without touching the main code.
    -    This really helped me in my portfolio, I used branches for each feature (like the About section, skills, etc.), and it felt super organized. I could try out things without messing up the main version.
  
2. I thought merging branches was just clicking a button and it is done.
   -    i learned about conflicts. I had merge conflicts and had to figure out which version of the code to keep. It was stressful at first, but I learned how Git thinks.
   -    Now I’m more careful with changes and I commit often. My portfolio stayed clean and organized even after several updates.
  
3. i used to assume the project board tab in github repositories.
   -    i learned about them this time. Using them helped me stay focused. I broke my portfolio into steps like “Add homepage,” “Style header,” or “Make admin panel.” It made the project feel more doable and less overwhelming.
   -    This helped as I stayed consistent and always knew what to work on next. It was like having a mini roadmap just for me.
  
4. i learnt how to structure a commit message.
   -    I used to just write “update” or “changes” and move on.
   -    I learned that good commit messages actually tell a story. They help me understand what I did and why, especially when looking back after a week or more.
   -    This helped me as i now I write clear messages like feat: add hero section or fix: correct nav link. It makes my project feel more professional and easier to manage.





Example format:

**🧠 What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**
**1. Concept: Branching**

`Expectation 👀` : I thought branching was just for developers working on big apps—nothing I’d need for a small project.

`Reality 😅`: Turns out even solo devs need branches! It helped me avoid breaking my main code while testing new designs.

`Impact 💡`: I created a feature branch for my "About Me" section and merged it smoothly into the main branch after testing. Super useful!

## 4. Screenshots of Key GitHub Features

Include screenshots that demonstrate how you used GitHub to manage your project. For each screenshot, write a short caption explaining what it shows.

> Upload the screenshots to your GitHub repository and reference them here using Markdown image syntax:
> (you could just simply copy and paste the image into the Assignment.md)

```markdown
